Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, California, LaTulippe was hired as a script reader at New Line Cinema, a job he was offered by his friend who worked at the studio. After working there for two years, he tired of the job, saying that it \"start[ed] to suck away [my] creativity\".[1] In July 2008, he sold a spec script titled Going the Distance to New Line Cinema, a story based on his friend David Neustadter's previous long-term relationship.[1] The film was ultimately directed by Nanette Burstein and released in September 2010.\n",

      "Observation 1: John Henry O'Hara (January 31, 1905 – April 11, 1970) was an American writer. He was one of America's most prolific writers of short stories, credited with helping to invent The New Yorker magazine short story style.[1] He became a best-selling novelist before the age of 30 with Appointment in Samarra and BUtterfield 8. While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated, his work was praised by such contemporaries as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and his champions rank him highly among the major under-appreciated American writers of the 20th century.[2][3][4] Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.. \"O’Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive,\" wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of The Paris Review, in a 2013 appreciation of O'Hara's work.\n",

Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful\" poetry of Gitanjali.[7] In 1913, Tagore became the first non-European to win a Nobel Prize in any category, and also the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by the sobriquets Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.[a]. A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[12] and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha (\"Sun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism,[15] he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain.\n",

      "Observation 3: Dark Horse is the fifth studio album by the English rock musician George Harrison. It was released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living in the Material World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse is associated with the controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour by a member of the Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the programme, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.. Harrison wrote and recorded Dark Horse during an extended period of upheaval in his personal life.\n",

Stza was raised in New York by his mother, who he classified as an \"over-protective Jewish mom\". He rarely saw his biological father, and his stepfather died by suicide.[2] As a teenager, he dropped out of high school, ran away from home, and began riding freight trains.[3] During this time, he began using heroin and crack cocaine. He later described drugs as a positive influence in his life and said that he would have killed himself during this time if not for drugs because he was \"very lonely and suicidal.\"[4]. In 1990, Stza and a friend of his, Alec Baillie, formed No Commercial Value, which later evolved into Choking Victim and then again into Leftöver Crack.\n",

The text was compiled from the King James Bible and the Coverdale Psalter[n 2] by Charles Jennens. It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere a year later. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music..

Because of the name and location, it is frequently confused with Golden Gate National Cemetery, a few miles south of the city.. About 1937, San Francisco residents voted to no longer build cemeteries within the city proper and, as a result, the site for a new national cemetery was selected south of the city limits. The cemetery is one of only four officially existing within San Francisco city limits (the others being the Columbarium of San Francisco, the historic graveyard next to Mission Dolores, and the sarcophagus of Thomas Starr King)..

It had been a fortified location since September 17, 1776, when New Spain established the presidio to gain a foothold in Alta California and the San Francisco Bay. It passed to Mexico in 1820, which in turn passed to the United States in 1848.[6] As part of a military reduction program under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process from 1988, Congress voted to end the Presidio's status as an active military installation of the U.S. Army.[7] On October 1, 1994, it was transferred to the National Park Service, ending 219 years of military use and beginning its next phase of mixed commercial and public use.[8].\n",

They recorded their debut EP with producer Sylvia Massy, who has produced records for such bands as Tool, System of a Down, Johnny Cash, Red Hot Chili Peppers and others. The resulting EP, Circle of Wolves, was released in the summer of 2011 by the experimental German label Surrism-Phonoethics.[1]. In late 2011, the band relocated to Los Angeles and played a series of shows in Hollywood including the Whisky a Go Go, broadening their appeal and shaping their sound from industrial noise to the 1990s alternative rock of Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine..\n",

      "Observation 2: Giacomo Benvenuti (16 March 1885, Toscolano – 20 January 1943, Barbarano-Salò) was an Italian composer and musicologist.[1][2][3]. He was the son of organist Cristoforo Benvenuti and studied at the Liceo Musicale (now the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini) in Bologna under Luigi Torchi (musicology) and Marco Enrico Bossi (organ).[4] In 1919 his collection of songs for voice and piano accompaniment, Canti a una voce : con accompagnamento di pianoforte, was published in Bologna.[5] In 1922 he published a collection of 17th-century art songs entitled 35 Arie di vari autori del secolo XVII. Composer Samuel Barber studied the works of Giulio Caccini, Andrea Falconieri, and other early Italian composers under his tutelage in Milan in 1933–1934.[6] For the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma he adapted Claudio Monteverdi's L'Orfeo for a production which premiered on 27 December 1934.[7] The adaptation was later used for the first recording of L'Orfeo in 1939,[8] which included a performance by the orchestra of La Scala Milan under conductor Ferrucio Calusio.[9][10].

      "Observation 3: Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi[n 1] (baptized 15 May 1567 – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, choirmaster and string player. A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and Baroque periods of music history.. Born in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c. 1590–1613) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di cappella at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics..

The word dungeon comes from French donjon (also spelled dongeon), which means \"keep\", the main tower of a castle. The first recorded instance of the word in English was near the beginning of the 14th century when it held the same meaning as donjon. The earlier meaning of \"keep\" is still in use for academics, although in popular culture, it has come to mean a cell or \"oubliette\".[citation needed] Though it is uncertain, both dungeon and donjon are thought to derive from the Middle Latin word dominus, meaning \"lord\" or \"master\".[1].\n",

      "Observation 1: Talking Heads were an American band formed in New York City during 1975.[2] The band was composed of David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described as \"one of the most critically acclaimed groups of the '80s,\" Talking Heads helped to pioneer new wave music by combining elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with \"an anxious yet clean-cut image\";[3] they have been called \"a properly postmodernist band\".[10]. Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth met as freshmen at the Rhode Island School of Design, where Byrne and Frantz were part of a band called the Artistics.[1]: 24  The trio moved to New York City in 1975, adopted the name Talking Heads, joined the New York punk scene, and recruited Harrison to round out the band. Their debut album, Talking Heads: 77, was released in 1977 to positive reviews.[11] They collaborated with the British producer Brian Eno on the acclaimed albums More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978), Fear of Music (1979), and Remain in Light (1980), which blended their art school sensibilities with influence from artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic and Fela Kuti.[3] From the early 1980s, they included additional musicians in their recording sessions and shows, including guitarist Adrian Belew, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, singer Nona Hendryx, and bassist Busta Jones.. Talking Heads reached their commercial peak in 1983 with the U.S.\n",

      "Observation 1: Absurd is a German black metal band[4] that has been classified as a \"right-wing extremist\" group by the Thuringian Landesbehörde für Verfassungsschutz.[5]. The band was founded in Sondershausen by Hendrik Möbus (also known as Randall Flagg, Jarl Flagg Nidhögg and JFN) and Sebastian Schauseil (Dark Mark Doom) in 1992, with a third member, Andreas Kirchner, joining at a later stage.. Their lyrics concern nationalistic, pagan (Hendrik Möbus is the founder of the Deutsche Heidnische Front), pro-heathen revivalist Germanic, and anti-Judeo-Christian themes.. The band achieved infamy because its original members (not in the band since 1999) murdered Sandro Beyer, a 15-year-old boy,[6] in 1993. The canonical motive is that Beyer was privy to an illicit relationship of Schauseil's with a married woman, and had been spreading rumours about this and other activities of the band.[7] On 29 April in Sondershausen, the then-17-year-old band members Möbus, Schauseil, and Kirchner enticed Beyer to a meeting, and strangled him there with an electrical cord.\n",

Pirandello's tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the Theatre of the Absurd.. Pirandello was born into an upper-class family in Girgenti (now Agrigento), Sicily, near the poor suburb of Porto Empedocle. The area was called \"Caos\", from càusi, Sicilian for \"trousers\", after the shape of a nearby ravine. Luigi Pirandello claimed to have Greek origins in an interview to Kostas Ouranis in 1934.\n",

Nevertheless, it has a wide variety of habitats, including Mopane, Combretum and brachystegia woodland, as well as open savanna, dambo, and riverine areas. Mwabvi was the last natural home to Malawi's Black Rhino population, but both wildlife and woodland have been poached over recent years. However many species of antelope, including kudu, sable, impala and nyala, are present, and even leopard and hyena have been seen. Buffalo still bathe in the Mwabvi river, and, although the number of human tourists is low, lions from neighbouring Mozambique are regular visitors.\n",

Since 1932, the company has been owned by the Stern family in Switzerland[4] and remains the last family-owned independent watch manufacturer in Geneva.[5] Patek Philippe is one of the oldest watch manufacturers in the world with an uninterrupted watchmaking history since its founding.[6][7][8] It designs and manufactures timepieces as well as movements, including some of the most complicated mechanical watches. The company maintains over 400 retail locations globally and over a dozen distribution centers across Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania. In 2001, it opened the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva.[9][10][11]. Patek Philippe is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious watch manufacturers in the world.[12][13][14][15] As of July 2023, among the world's top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auctions, nine were Patek Philippe watches.\n",

Since the early 1990s, the Chinese government invested significantly in transforming Hunchun into a regional economic center, thanks in large part to the influence of the former Jilin governor Wang Zhongyu, whose work with Zhu Rongji allowed him to become the first head of China's State Economic and Trade Commission.[9] On 9 March 1992 the Chinese parliament approved to set up Hunchun Border Economic Cooperation Zone.\n",

      "Observation 2: Test Icicles were a short-lived rock band that formed in England in 2004, primarily influenced by post-hardcore, dance-punk and indie rock but containing musical elements from a variety of genres (notably dance, hip hop, crossover thrash, and punk). The band was formed by Rory Attwell and Sam Mehran, who were later joined by Dev Hynes. Hynes and Mehran were both 18 years old at the time of the band's inception. The group has since become notable due to the later success of its members.. Prior to forming the band, Atwell, Hynes and Mehran (all of whom shared vocal and guitar duties) had met each other through mutual friends.\n",

The capital of the territory was first Oregon City, then Salem, followed briefly by Corvallis, then back to Salem, which became the state capital upon Oregon's admission to the Union.. Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the region that became the Oregon Territory was explored by Europeans first by sea.\n",

      "Observation 1: The Pioneer Helmet (also known as the Wollaston Helmet or Northamptonshire Helmet), is an Anglo-Saxon boar-crested helmet from the late seventh century found in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, United Kingdom. It was discovered during a March 1997 excavation before the land was to be mined for gravel and was part of the grave of a young man. Other objects in the grave, such as a hanging bowl and a pattern welded sword, suggest that it was the burial mound of a high-status warrior.. The sparsely decorated nature of the helmet, a utilitarian iron fighting piece, belies its rarity. It is one of just six Anglo-Saxon helmets yet discovered, joined by finds from Benty Grange (1848), Sutton Hoo (1939), Coppergate (1982), Shorwell (2004) and Staffordshire (2009); its basic form is nearly identical to that of the richer Coppergate helmet found in York.\n",

Rounders is a striking and fielding team game that involves hitting a small, hard, leather-cased ball with a wooden, plastic, or metal bat that has a rounded end. The players score by running around the four bases on the field.[2][3]. Played in England since Tudor times, it is referenced in 1744 in the children's book A Little Pretty Pocket-Book where it was called Base-Ball.[4][5] The name baseball was superseded by the name rounders in England, while other modifications of the game played elsewhere retained the name baseball.[6] The game is popular among British and Irish school children, particularly among girls.[4][7][8] As of 2015[update], rounders is played by an estimated seven million children in the UK.[9]. Gameplay centres on a number of innings, in which teams alternate at batting and fielding.\n",

He has also taken part in auto racing, participated in reality shows such as Celebrity Big Brother in 2018 and appeared as a judge on The All Ireland Talent Show.[1]. Born to Brendan and Noeleen Lynch, a mechanic and housewife,[2] and raised in Donaghmede, North-east Dublin, Lynch struggled with his education during his school years due to dyslexia,[3] but excelled at sports and was a motor racing enthusiast, winning the Portuguese BMX Championship at fourteen.[4] Around this period he was expelled from school and began to work with his father as a mechanic.[5]. In 1993, music manager Louis Walsh, who had managed Johnny Logan, held auditions in Dublin to find a new boyband to rival British group Take That. Lynch was among the hopefuls present, and was eventually selected.[6] Before even recording any material, he and five other successful auditionees made their infamous appearance on RTÉ's The Late Late Show with Gay Byrne.\n",

After early successes in the Christian rock scene, Switchfoot first gained mainstream recognition with the inclusion of four of their songs in the 2002 film A Walk to Remember. This recognition led to the release of their major label debut The Beautiful Letdown, which was released in 2003 and featured the hit singles \"Meant to Live\" and \"Dare You to Move\". Their fifth album, Nothing Is Sound  peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, and included the single \"Stars.\" Their seventh album, Hello Hurricane (2009) received a Grammy Award for Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album.\n",

Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions. They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at, the order of the cosmos, and repel Isfet, which was chaos.\n",

The Süleymaniye Mosque is one of the best-known sights of Istanbul and from its location on the Third Hill it commands an extensive view of the city around the Golden Horn.

He was best known for his work on the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated shorts for Warner Bros., as well as his work as a director of live-action comedy films.. Born in Weehawken, New Jersey, Tashlin drifted from job to job after dropping out of high school in New Jersey at age 13.[4] In 1930, he began working for John Foster as a cartoonist on the Aesop's Fables cartoon series, then worked briefly for Amadee J. Van Beuren, but he was just as much a drifter in his animation career as he had been as a teenager.[5] Tashlin joined Leon Schlesinger's cartoon studio at Warner Bros. as an animator in 1933, where he was known as a fast animator.\n",

Wu worked on the Manhattan Project, where she helped develop the process for separating uranium into uranium-235 and uranium-238 isotopes by gaseous diffusion. She is best known for conducting the Wu experiment, which proved that parity is not conserved. This discovery resulted in her colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang winning the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics, while Wu herself was awarded the inaugural Wolf Prize in Physics in 1978.

      "Observation 1: The Laleli Mosque (Turkish: Laleli Camii, lit. 'Tulip Mosque') is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.[1]. The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5]. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (külliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa.[6] Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774.[7] The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake[4] and, according to Ünver Rüstem, by a fire in 1783.[7] In 1783 it was fully restored.[7][2] The restoration, which Doğan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha,[4][2] preserved the original mosque's appearance.[7] The mausoleum's façade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century.[6] The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911.[6]. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time.[8][9][10] The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes.[11][5] The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque.[12][2] The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque – the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor – but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture.[13].\n",

It was presented to the Princess Esma Sultan, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz, as a wedding gift in 1889.. The mansion remained in the possession of the Ottoman dynasty until 1915. Subsequently, the building was used first as a tobacco warehouse and then as a coal depot from 1920 until 1975 when it was destroyed by a fire.[1].\n",

The plants are also known as parrot's beak, parrot's bill and lobster claw – all references to the distinctive flowers. There is also a variety with white to creamy coloured flowers called: \"Albus\", and a variety with rosy pink flowers called: \"Roseus\".[3]. Kakabeak grows to around two metres high, with spreading branches producing leaf stalks up to 15 cm long bearing several pairs of small leaflets. They usually flower from spring through to early summer, but can flower twice a year or even year round.[4].\n",

Another explanation is its use in wattle and daub huts of the early settlers.[1] The species has a number of other common names include callicoma, butterwood, silver leaf, silver-leaf butterwood and wild quince.. Black wattle can grow up to 20 metres in height, though in cultivation it is more likely to reach a height of between 6 and 10 m with a 3-metre spread.\n",

He influenced many artists, including Buddy Holly,[3] the Beatles, the Rolling Stones,[4] the Animals, George Thorogood, Syd Barrett,[5] and the Clash.[6]. His use of African rhythms and a signature beat, a simple five-accent hambone rhythm, is a cornerstone of hip hop, rock, and pop music.[4][7][8] In recognition of his achievements, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Blues Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2017.[9][7][10] He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[11] Diddley is also recognized for his technical innovations, including his use of tremolo and reverb effects to enhance the sound of his distinctive rectangular guitars.[12][13]. Bo Diddley was born in McComb, Mississippi,[nb 1] as Ellas Otha Bates (also stated as Otha Ellas Bates or Elias Otha Bates).[15] He was the only child of Ethel Wilson, a  sharecropper's teenaged daughter, and Eugene Bates,[16] whom he never knew. Wilson was only sixteen, and being unable to support a family, she gave her cousin, Gussie McDaniel,[17] permission to raise her son.[14] McDaniel eventually adopted him, and he assumed her surname.[18] Diddley denied ever having the name \"Otha\" in a 2001 interview, saying \"I don't know where they got that 'Otha' from\",[19] but his website, maintained by his estate, confirms it as his middle name..\n",

The band had a string of hits throughout the mid-1960s, including \"For Your Love\", \"Heart Full of Soul\", \"Shapes of Things\", and \"Over Under Sideways Down\".. Originally a blues-based band noted for their signature \"rave-up\" instrumental breaks,[6] the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop, pioneered psychedelic rock and early hard rock, and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal trends.[7][6] Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance and Page formed Led Zeppelin.\n",
